    This work was inspired by Brandon Sanderson's dialogue only challenge. To see Brandon's response to his own prompt, see his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/i-hate-dragons/" target="_blank">I Hate Dragons!</a> short story. Below is my take on the challenge.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4"><i>Prompt</i></p>

    <p class="mb-4"><i>
    Write a five- to ten-page two-character dialogue with no tags or blocking (~1000 words). Try to evoke character, conflict, and plot using only dialogue. Include: a problem, two distinct individuals, a fantasy/sf element. Avoid: long monologues, exposition. Use context, not explanations.

“Fuck.”

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s not… Why is it not…”

“You look constipated. Here, let me.”

“Don’t touch me. I can do it.”

“You somehow look constipated and like you’re shitting yourself at the same time.”

“No one asked for your opinion.”

“For fuck’s sake, raise your elbow or you’ll blow a hole in the actuator, and it’ll be my ass on the line.”

“I said I could do it. See.”

“The cooling hose is leaking.”

“Shit.”

“You need to seal the line with a …”

“Stop! Stop! Let me figure it out.”

“Suit yourself.”

“Fine. Show me how to fix the leak.”

“Like I was trying to say, you need to seal the line with a rubber gasket and a steel wingnut. There are five-millimeter gaskets in the tool compartment on the port side of the hub.”

“I don’t see them.”

“Look with your Sight, not your eyes.”

“I am!”

“Close your eyes then if you don’t need them.”

“Dammit.”

“I told you.”

“Stop gloating and help me before I puke all over this fancy ass spaceship.”

“Return to Warrior Three and try again but start with your eyes closed and hands out in Star Position. That’s it.”

“That worked!”

“Okay now slowly bring it around to the starboard side. Watch the rotating comm unit. WATCH THE COMMS!”

“Oops.”

“Get another one. And this time, go slow and controlled. That’s it. Very nice. Now tighten the nut”

“Hehe. Nut.”

“So mature. And stick your tongue back in your mouth.”

“You know you like it.”

“At least have the decency to behave civilized when we’re in public.”

“There!”

“It looks good, but let’s test it. Push that button.”

“This one?”

“Yes.”

“You sure?”

“Do you not trust your work? You can check it with your Sight yourself.”

“No, I trust myself.”

“Then push the button.”

“Okay, I’m pushing the button… Nothing happened. Is something supposed to happen?”

“No, that means it is working. You can tell by looking at the temperature meters in front of you.” 

“Where?”

“Right here. No, no, open your eyes. Look with your eyeballs, not your Sight. Sorry.”

“Oh.”

“Let’s find the ship’s owner and report that we finished.”

“Isn’t that him coming over right now?”

“What do you know… Hello, Mr. Shaffer! You came just in time! The compressor is now fixed and fully operational. Thank you for having us onboard the Eros 3. An invoice will be sent to your comm hub promptly.”

“Thank you, both of you. I’ve never seen remote workers in action before. Your poses are outstanding. You look like the ballerinas in Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake.”

“I haven’t seen a ballet before but thank you. Do you happen to have another shuttle for us to get transport back?”

“Oh, yes, yes. My assistant, yes, here are your passes. We have a supply shuttle scheduled to leave in ten minutes from the loading dock back to Diamora. I assume you know where the loading dock is? Well, yes, of course you do, you’re remote workers. You see everything. I just have one question for you, for purely academic purposes you see. Does it hurt when you extended your consciousness out from your body? I know you have your poses and all but I cannot imagine…”

“No.”

“Yes. The pain is excruciating.”

“Stop lying, Quinn. No, it does not hurt us, Mr. Shaffer.”

“Doesn’t hurt, mostly. Ow! See! Sometimes it hurts because this big oaf likes to elbow me in the ribs.”

“Well, I thank both of you for your troubles. We would have certainly lost a bot or two to rad damage had we sent them out there, so I am truly indebted to your services.” 

“It is no trouble at all. We’re just doing our jobs. Again, the invoice will be sent to your ship’s comm channel shortly.”

“Yes, yes, that’s splendid to hear. Splendid to hear indeed.”

“We better leave you to it then. Thank you for the transport passes.”

“Ta ta!”

“Don’t do that.”

“Do what?!”

“Lie to civilians. They have a hard time accepting us as it is. Lies can spread faster than a ship fire. And giving civilians any excuse not to contract us will only hurt.”

“Oh, c’mon. These people don’t care about us.”

“Shhh. We’re still on their ship. Lower your voice.”

“Fine. They don’t care about us. They just care about profits. Hiring a few remote workers to fix their spacecraft is waaay cheaper than sending out dumb bots and exposing them to radiation, even if they think we’re whack jobs.”

“We’ll talk about this later… Hello, we are the remote works that were called in to fix the compressor. We have passes from Mr. Shaffer himself.

“Right this way, sir.”

“And ma’am.”

“Yes, and ma’am.”

“Wow, he called me <i>ma’am</i>. I should feel <i>honored</i>.”

“Don’t patronize me.”

“I’m not the one insisting on archaic titles that assume my gender.”

“Sit right here. We will depart in four minutes.”

“Thank you.”

“Why must you <i>insist</i> people call me ma’am?”

“You identify as femme, yes?”

“Yes.”

“Then stop complaining. We deserve respect. And titles are the simplest way to remind people that our positions are deserved.”

“Like I’ve said before, that’s not the point. Titles aren’t a problem, it’s the gendered ones that are the issue. Gender shouldn’t play a role in titles.”

“So what do you prefer to be referred to as then?”

“Lord Ruler.”

“You’re ridiculous.”

“I’m serious. You know, I’ve been thinking…”

“Hmmm?”

“It would be nice to be called Lord Ruler in bed.”

“Is Queen not cutting it for you?”

“Nope. Lord Ruler is better.”

“And what would subjects of the Lord Ruler be called then?”

“Lieutenants. You in particular would be my Lieutenant Prime.”

“Lieutenant Prime. I like how that sounds.”

“Our 2 o’clock appointment got cancelled, right?”

“That’s right.”

“Then a quickie in the shop before our 4 o’clock?”

“It’ll be my pleasure, Lord Ruler.”

“I’m already getting tingles, Lieutenant.”

“Shhh, they’ll think we’ve lost it.”

“They’ve already paid. Let them.”
