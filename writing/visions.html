The Scholar’s Prophecy:
</p><p class="mb-4">

<i>A Fury made of rage and chaos will ascend upon the world in a time of war.</i>
</p><p class="mb-4">

<i>With love and protection, this storm of chaos will wreak havoc, but remake the o’erworld anew in peace.</i>
</p><p class="mb-4">

<i>Else, hate will weaponize and a daemon will be unleashed from the underworld.</i>
</p><p class="mb-4">

<i>It is up to you to guide the path.</i>

</p><p class="mb-4">

“You can’t do this!” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Strong hands grasp my arms and waist, rendering me useless as Percy is dragged away. Her slight frame and blonde curls disappear behind the throng of bodies that block my path to her.
</p><p class="mb-4">

A shadow looms. Eurynomos. “We all discussed this, and we agreed that the benefit of the many outweighs the detriment of one.” By “we,” he means the community elders, in a conversation that neither I nor Percy were privy to. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

His blue-gray eyes are full of pity. He has the audacity to actually smile – smile – at me. I want to smack that condescending grin off his senile face and curse him to the depths of Hades. But I can’t, literally, because two men are holding my hands behind my back, restraining me from doing just that… among other things. Eurynomos turns his back to me, walking down the stairs. The community leader joins the rest of the cohort of elders on the airship, the largest of the fleet and the only one left here after the others were sent off to help with the war. The crew raises the sails, preparing for flight. Eurynomos ties my little sister to mainmast on the deck by her wrists. She looks up and says something, but whatever she says is promptly drowned out as gigantic engines whirl to life.
</p><p class="mb-4">

In one last attempt to board the ship, I kick behind me to where I hope is the location of a kneecap. My foot doesn’t connect but instead sails through the air behind me, sending my weight forward. The brief loosening of the grip on my arms is quickly replaced by a squeezing of my chest and a breathlessness as I feel the other man lift me up off my feet, which is wholly unfair for a grown man to use his weight to overpower a malnourished seventeen-year-old girl. Regardless, I kick my feet in the air wildly. The man is undeterred, the arms holding fast. I let my body go limp and watch as the large wooden hull rises in front of me. It blasts me with a whoosh of air. And with that, it blows away any hope of grabbing Percy and escaping into the surrounding forest, at least before I do anything drastic or dangerous. Now, I have no choice.
</p><p class="mb-4">

As soon as my feet touch the ground again, I yank my arms free. To Hades with them. Time to be drastic. I will not sit here helplessly as they force my sister into using her power. The last time she used her foresight, she saw our own mother’s death. And despite our race back home nine months ago, we could not prevent the disaster from happening. Percy was so innocent then. Now, she wakes up screaming every morning, reliving our mother’s murder over and over again. I have never felt so utterly helpless in those moments right after she wakes, holding her and whispering in her ear that she is okay until she brings herself back into the world of the living. I cannot imagine what another episode would do to her, what horrors she might see. Foreseeing the deaths of the last batch community members – those planning to set out tomorrow – to join the war is NOT worth my sister’s sanity.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I run up the trail that circumnavigates the mountain, my desperation fueling my legs. I wrap my skarpa around my mouth and nose to protect my lungs from the dust. I breathe deeply through the sheer material, imagining the air relieving my burning muscles from the run. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

We should have left when we had the chance. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I knew the risks with staying in one place for too long. But Percy wanted to stay. And I was too relieved at the respite, of finally having warm meals brought to me, not going hungry when I failed in my hunts, that for the first time in nine months, I relented. And so, we stayed. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I was a fool.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I peer into the sculpted caves that sporadically pocket the cliffside, looking for something that might give me an advantage. Community members stare out from the caverns, and I can only imagine what they see – my disheveled brown curls plastered to my brow in sweat, with my deep black eyes staring out from behind my dust-colored skarpa. If I paused long enough to make eye contact with them, they might notice the power seething inside of me, just below my wild façade. They might feel uneasy, as if someone is watching them from behind. It would be the same feeling they get when they gaze into Charon’s eyes – the community mage. It is how they recognized my sister’s power. But I didn’t let them know. I kept my eyes downcast, not out of deference like everyone assumed, but to protect my secret. My sister was just too trusting with her eyes.
</p><p class="mb-4">

My legs start to burn, but I bare down and force myself to breathe. Wind whips at my face, blowing my skarpa loose, but it doesn’t matter now because the rocky road is no longer dusty. The cool air cools my sweat as my heart thrums against my ribcage. I pump my arms to get over the steepest part of the traverse. I am now high enough that the path narrows to only a couple of feet wide on the rocky slope, the slope so steep to my left and right that it is all but inhospitable the most tenacious trees and shrubs. The wind makes my eyes tear up. I wipe them dry with the side of my hand. I breathe deeply. The cave dwellings up here are more sporadic, mostly filled with those who want to live as far away as possible from the everyone else below.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Finally, next to one of the small landing platforms jutting out of the mountainside, I see exactly what I need. A small hovercraft is tied to the moor on the platform, a short length of flattened dirt jutting out from a cave entrance. The craft small enough that is likely for personal use only; I cannot imagine it fitting more than four or five people at once, and all standing at that. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I untie the craft from the wooden post, throwing the coarse rope into the basket. I roll the thing back and forth – it is heavier than I expect considering it flies – to the edge of the platform. The wind buffets both me and the craft, and I tighten my grip. I am about to climb in when I hear a voice echo from inside the docking cave. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You cannot possibly think you can fly that.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

A short, middle-aged woman with the sun-tanned skin of a pilot emerges from the shadows onto the platform with me, crossing her arms and giving me a dubious look. The intricate tattoos indicating her schooling are hidden underneath the sleeves of her flying jacket. While I may not be able to see them, I feel the magic swirling in conjunction within, like any mage or another scholar would. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Blast the sun to Hades.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Of all the community members that could have caught me stealing a hovercraft, Arete is by far the worst one to do so. I was hoping to completely avoid the scholar the entire time we were here – she is reclusive after all – but it seems my luck has run out at the most inopportune moment. I immediately revert my eyes down to the hovercraft, lest she sees the power sparkling behind them. While scholars might not be able to call upon power like mages, they can certainly recognize power when they see it. They just normally don’t leave Delphi.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Of course I can.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar raises one singular eyebrow. I climb in and look back at her. She hasn’t moved an inch, still watching me as before.
</p><p class="mb-4">

If she is just going to watch as I take her hovercraft, then that works even better for me. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I look down at the control panel, a series of metal switches and needles inlaid into the woven basket. The wind whistles in my air, shaking the craft. I peer over the edge into the empty expanse beyond, the green of the forest below tiny so far away. I am suddenly aware of how high up we are. Of how far I’ll drop.
</p><p class="mb-4">

To Hades. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You’re right, I can’t fly this.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I don’t hear anything. I peel my eyes away from the emptiness in front of me and turn to face, looking her full in the face. Her eyes are a warm brown, the color of a young doe in the springtime. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“So can you pilot this for me? I need to get to my sister.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

If she recognizes that I am a mage, nothing in her face gives any indication.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Look. In case you’re not aware, my sister is a mage, but she only has the ability to foresee death. Eurynomos and the other elders took her on the last airship to force her to foresee the death of the last group of people they are sending to the war. But it is not worth it, I promise you. I cannot let the ritual happen. Please help me. I know you can fly this thing. And we need to get to her before they make her lose her mind. You have to help me. Please.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I hear how absolutely pathetic I sound. I swallow. She continues to look at me, into me, into my eyes. Heat rises in my cheeks. I hate depending on someone else, especially when it comes to me sister.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Finally, she clears her throat and speaks, her voice deep and sonorous. “To be clear, you are asking me to help you intervene against my elders?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Yes! It won’t help you if my sister loses her mind and cannot recognize reality. A scholar should know how unpredictable foresight is.” If she didn’t realize I was a mage, she certainly knows now. I stare into her eyes, the eyes of a coward if she refuses to help. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

An expression I cannot quite place crosses the scholar’s features before she recomposes herself. “Fine.” She disappears into the shadows of the cave. Finally, she moves, grabbing her headgear and hopping into the basket. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

She… agreed? I was expecting more of a fight.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar reappears, sporting piloting headgear and goggles, and tosses me my own pair of goggles. I snatch it out of the air and fasten them on, my braids smushed tight against my head. The fur-lining around the eyes immediately makes my face sweat. The scholar places her hands on the rim of the basket and launches herself inside with a grace that seems. The craft suddenly feels smore solid with her in it.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I move out of the way of the control panel, the scent of pine and leather wafting from her as she passes me. The fans below us turn on, the change almost imperceptible except for the slight vibrations in the soles of my boots. Without any more discussion, the scholar throws forward a lever and we take off. Not as fast as I would have liked, but certainly much faster than I could have run on the ground. The elders’ airship is a speck in the distance, but still visible to our right. I don’t need to point it out though the hovercraft accelerates smoothly up and towards the other ship before settling into a monotonous pursuit, the craft leaning forward into the motion. I brace myself against the lean by gripping the basket rim, but the vibrations soon make my hands numb. I will us to go faster while trying not to lean too far forward. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

After only a few heartbeats, I know we won’t catch up. Despite the lighter craft, our forward thrusters cannot keep pace with the behemoth sails on the elder’s airship. The same wind that powers those sails pushes against our ship, whipping the loose strands of hair around my face, although the goggles prevent the hair from getting into my eyes.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Is this as fast as you can go?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The silence all the confirmation I need. I look over my shoulder to see the scholar giving me the same pitying look that Eurynomos gave me. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

To Hades with that look.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I take a deep breath to gather myself, mustering the courage to do what I need to do next. “Teach me how to cast a rain spell then,” I demand.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Excuse me?” The scholar turns off the forward thrusters and we stall in midair.
</p><p class="mb-4">

No, no, no. We need to catch up.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“They will be forced to land if it’s raining, right? The lift engines won’t work with the extra moisture.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“First of all, your attitude is preposterous. Second, I’m not sure how you know that, but there isn’t a cloud in the sky. How do you suppose you going to collect enough moisture to make it rain?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“There is a lake seven miles north that I will borrow water from.” I remember passing it three weeks ago, before Percy and I found the cave dwelling community. Well, before they found us. Their hunter happened to check their snares at the same inopportune time I was relieving them of their catch. It feels like that was an eternity ago. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Please.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I don’t think that’s a good idea. Too much change could have catastrophic consequences. Have you even used weather work before?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I think back to the tracking magic I used when necessary to help Percy and I survive for the past nine months in the wilderness. Every time, it required all my focus to limit the magic from taking more than what it needed, limiting the small uses of power to just scratching the top of the well rather than losing myself into the spell. “No, but I’m capable. And I know you were good at your previous job.” Okay, I don’t know, but with the amount of power I feel emanating from her tattoos, I can only assume both her arms are covered. And scholars don’t usually leave Delphi.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“A mage without experience in weather work should not cast such a large spell without a focusing device, especially one that requires conversion of a resource and a moving target.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The words are meaningless to me, other than the fact she clearly said no.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Fine. If you won’t help me…” I raise my hands, directing my will towards the airship, imagining rain hitting the wooden hull and interrupting the lift engines. It is the same way I call on magic to do my tracking spells.
</p><p class="mb-4">

A hiss echoes in my ears as the scholar grabs my hands, pulling them down and holding them at my sides. “You’ll kill us both if you do that.” Her grip is like a vice, but her hands feel strong and weathered from work rather than brute strength.
</p><p class="mb-4">

But I have already called upon magic, and it ripples invisibly around us, waiting for a purpose. The hair on my arm raises, responding to the air crackling with magic. The scholar mumbles curses under her breath as well as some other choice words I haven’t heard before. I store the new curses away in my mind.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Weather wants to be given clear instructions. If you do not be specific, it will use the ambiguity to Strike. You. Down. Preferably with lightning. That is, unless you give all your power,” she jabs a finger at my hands, “some direction. Give me a second.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar bends down an opens the engine hatch at the base of the craft. A bound leather case is strapped to the underside of a fan shield. She expertly unlatches the case, not flinching as the rotating fans go thrump, thrump inches from her fingers. The scholar refastens the engine hatch and rummages around in the satchel. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You are right-handed, yes?” She asks. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I nod. She keeps looking for something and then looks up at me expectantly. I realize she did not see me nod. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Yes, I’m right-handed.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Perfect. Put this on your right hand.” She hands me a small black cloth. It is heavier than expected, and I realize it is a glove with the fingers cut off, a circular metal ring sewn into the palm. The scholar then yanks the left sleeve of my coat up past my elbow and clasps a leather sleeve the entire length of my forearm onto it, sinching the three buckles tight. The leather looks gigantic on my thing arm, and it is still a little loose, even at the smallest notches for the buckles. Three circular rings that match the one on my glove lie lengthwise down my arm.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I made this for my old mage,” the scholar says. She snaps three gadgets into the three circular rings on my new arm sleeve with a metallic click as each locks into place. The two closest to my elbow looking like exact copies of each other. My arm feels very heavy, and it is only because the scholar grasps my arm that I am able to hold it up for more than a second.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“These first two help you direct the elements – earth, air, water, and light.” As she says each element, she points to the corresponding symbol etched into one of four concentric circles. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Because you are converting lake water to rain, we need to set the first element director to earth and water. Use the biggest dial for water and the second biggest dial to earth. Make sure not to move the smallest two dials away from the blank spot, or you will initiate another element without giving it direction.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The gold dials are cold to the touch. My fingers, already numb from the flight, feel extra clumsy, especially with the clumsiness of wearing a glove.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Next, we need to set this director to water and air.” She points to the middle gadget. I rotate the dials of the middle director like the first, except the second dial one more tick counterclockwise so that air is in the north position.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“The last director is because we have a moving target. We don’t have enough time for me to explain relational spherical coordinates to you, so I’ll do this one.” She adjusts the three needles to point at different angles, looking up at the airship and making slight adjustments.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“One last piece.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

She bends down to fumble around in her satchel again before bringing out another circular gadget over. She grabs my right wrist and twists it so that my palm is facing up.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Open your hand.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I do. She clicks the gadget into the circular ring in my palm. It is mostly just a metal ring, the same outside as the gadgets on my arm. Except of having a gadget in the center, the space inside the ring is mostly empty. Only thin copper wire is woven like a spiderweb around the inside, converging on a smooth white marble at the center. I close my hand around the marble. The wire makes closing my fist stiff but not impossible. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“This is a focuser and helps you connect your directors to your magic and will. Now copy me.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar raises her right hands straight in front of her, her left arm relaxed at her side. I do the same, relieved I can finally drop my heavy left arm. “Good. Now that you have set up the spell, you need to give it the indication to start. With as much intention as you can muster, throw your hand down like this,” she demonstrates, pretending to slap her hand down on an imaginary table in front of her, “while thinking of what you want to happen.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

This part, at least, I am familiar with; the palm to the Earth is the same way I initiate my tracking spells, just without all the gear. I stare at the slowly diminishing airship. It is easy to summon intention from all my rage and desperation. In my head, I shout Rain! and bring my palm down forcibly, fingers splayed.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Stop the ritual.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The air, crackling with energy around us, explodes outward. I feel the pull of magic, asking for more, and this time, I let it take me, submitting to everything that the magic demands. Burning heat rise through me, scorching my bones, but the small marble in my hand spreads a coolness that keeps me from burning up. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

A waterspout rises from the lake far to our left and comes careening towards the airship in front of us. The sky darkens as clouds form. Another tug of magic, and I feel my autonomy leave myself, my magic now completely out of control. To my horror, I see the beginning of tornados forming from the ground up to the bank of clouds above us. I didn’t just make rain; I made a storm. The hovercraft rocks precariously in the air as a gust of wind forcibly knocks us sideways, breaking my focus just enough that the magic loosens its grip on me, and I regain control of myself. But it is too late, the storm already well seeded to form.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Hold on!” The scholar shouts over the howling wind as we go streaming up towards the clouds. I look to my left to see the tip of a forming cyclone rising besides us, keeping pace with our ascent. We race the forming tornados upwards. Just before we enter the cloud bank, I see a tornado swallow the elders’ airship. The airship with my sister on it. My heart sinks into the bottomless pit of my stomach, but I don’t have any more time to worry about Percy as we are immediately surrounded by the crackle and hiss of energy discharging within the clouds – the beginnings of lightning.
</p><p class="mb-4">

This is it. I didn’t give weather enough direction. And now I will be blasted out of the air with lightning. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I sit down in the basket, brining my knees up to my face in the crammed space, and squeeze my eyes shut. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Will death hurt? What wonders in the world have I yet to experience? Is my sister still alive? If she is, then who will protect her? Who will she become? Or will I see her soon on the River Styx? 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I brace for my inevitable end.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The lightning never strikes. The roaring in my ears subsides and the air feels cold and still. So cold in fact that it hurts my lungs to breath. I open my eyes to see clear blue skies above me, the scholar looking down out of the basket below us. I scramble to my feet and follow her gaze to the gray miasma of clouds below. Snapshots of light sporadically brighten the clouds below. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I suddenly feel lightheaded and nauseous, although I’m not sure if it’s from the extremity of the spell I just cast or the fact that we just raced so high up in the air so quickly. In either case, I manage to squeak out “How do I make it stop?” before puking over the side of the craft. My vomit immediately disperses and disappears against the dark clouds. My entire body feels like it has been punched a thousand-fold. Every vibration of the basket makes me all too aware of how weak and tired my legs are.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I might still die from this spell.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar hands me a square piece of cloth and I use it to wipe my mouth. It smells like sage and motor oil and is rough against my cheeks.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“With enough power, you can cast another spell to counteract the first one. But I’m not sure you can.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The thought of casting another spell makes my stomach flip and I swallow forcefully, hoping to push the nausea back down. I am about to claim that I can cast another spell when I puke, again. The back of my throat burns. My head feels like it might explode. My body is about ready to collapse. But I need to collect myself enough to stop this storm. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I didn’t want people to die. I just wanted the ritual to stop. I wipe my mouth with the cloth again and the scholar grasps my arm, steadying me. I look into her eyes, pitying eyes.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I can cast another spell. Tell me how to stop this storm before it destroys anything else.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar nods.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Take off the director arm band but keep the focusing glove on.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I look down at the gadgets on my arms and hands. Take off what?
</p><p class="mb-4">

She sighs and starts to unbuckle the sleeve on my left arm. I am relieved as the weight comes off and I shake my arm to get a little circulation back.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You are in no shape to cast another compound weather spell, so you’ll just have to cast a normal spell like you normally do and hope your intention gives your power enough direction. The glove on your right hand should help make the conversion between your intention and the effect more efficient though.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar lays her palm flat against mine, the cool marble between us. She removes her hand and nods, taking a step back to give me space.
</p><p class="mb-4">

It is up to me now.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I flex my gloved hand, admiring the flex and pop of the intricate woven wire. I force my stomach to settle enough to scrunch my hand into a fist, squeezing as tight as I can around the marble. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

For my sister, even if I puke my insides out in the process.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I open my mouth, opting to scream my intention rather than wordlessly giving into the spell like I usually do.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Stop this storm!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I open myself up, letting all my magic reserves to spill into that one word, including the last remnants of food uncontrollably spilling out of my mouth and onto the basket floor before the dry heaving sets in.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Once it feels like every last drop of magic has left my body, I look down below us.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The clouds are clearing, almost gone. As the last of them dissipate, I survey the ground and air space around us. I can see impossibly far along the horizon but the details of the ground. No other airship is in sight.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Time to go down.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar restarts the engines, and we descend, much slower than our ascent up. It gives me time to survey the damage below. There are huge swaths of forest that are completely flattened, the downed trees creating paths of brown amid the green foliage. The languid descent also gives me time to recover from the spells I casted, but nausea still nags at my stomach.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Here.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar hands me a small piece of a golden root.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Put this under your tongue and try not to swallow it until it completely dissolves.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She cuts another piece off with her knife and pops it into her mouth to demonstrate. I do the same. The strong scent and taste make my eyes water, but it helps with the nausea.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Instead of landing at the high landing platform we departed from, the scholar navigates us to the main landing platform at the base of the mountain, the one where the elders’ airship usually resides. The small cluster of buildings that used to surround that platform are completely obliterated, wood lying in splinters everywhere. We land on a patch of dirt just to the side of the debris, amid a copse of trees. The engines whirl off, and the ensuing silence is deafening.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Thank the skies we are finally on the ground again. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The smell of fresh cut pine fills my nostrils as we near, overpowering the last bit of the spicy root in my mouth. The scholar jumps out of the basket of the hovercraft. I throw my chest onto the basket rim and jump up, trying to lift my legs over the side of the basket. But I am too tired to make it all the way, and my heavy feet flop back into the basket. I rip off my goggles and throw them onto 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar looks at me. I look at her. She sighs. She walks over next to me and she bends over the rim into the basket. She grips my belt.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“What are you doi..” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Before I have a chance to finish my question, she hoists me out of the basket and I am airborne, my legs somehow above my head.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Hades!
</p><p class="mb-4">

My legs somehow comeback underneath me, but just as my feet touch the ground, they collapse under the impact. My body crumples and I my face collides with upturned dirt. I roll over and see the scholar staring down at me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Was that on purpose?
</p><p class="mb-4">

She offers me a hand. I grasp it, and she pulls me up onto my feet. But as I am about to turn away, she tightens her grip and pulls me towards her. I stumble into her body, noticing just how solidly she is built.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Don’t mention the fact that you casted a spell to anyone, or the fact that I helped you.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She squeezes my wrist, almost painfully tight. Her grip traps me more than when the two men were restraining me earlier from boarding the elders’ airship.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I have no choice but to agree.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I… I won’t.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Good.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She releases me and I sink back onto the ground. She walks away. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

A slight breeze caresses my cheeks. It feels warm compared to the chilly air we just came from.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy, are you okay?!
</p><p class="mb-4">

I place my hand on the ground and bow my forehead to the ground.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Show me whether my sister is alive.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

A little bit of magic trickles out of me and enters the dirt beneath my hand. From it, a small, white daffodil shoots up from the ground and unfurls its petals before me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

She’s alive! Percy is alive!
</p><p class="mb-4">

One by one, the daffodil loses its petals. They float down ominously, and as soon as the last one touches the ground, the stem wilts. The petals decay into the dirt and all evidence of the flower disappears a moment later.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Something is wrong.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stand up, a little too fast. I wait for the threat of unconsciousness to subside and join the scholar, who is walking towards the group of people rummaging through the wooden remains of the landing platform.
</p><p class="mb-4">

A man I don’t recognize spots us from amid the rubble.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Arete, thank the skies …”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Is anyone hurt or missing?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The man shakes his head. “Everyone is accounted for, other than the fifteen elders on the airship. Thankfully, almost everyone, other than the elders on the ship, were inside the caves. To think, all our village history lost. The storm looked unnatural though. Do you think there are wild mages in the forest?” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I doubt it. Maybe the ritual went amiss, and they accidentally summoned a storm.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Do the others know she is a scholar?
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I bet the elders’ airship was just grounded. Tysephone here will lead the search party, though. She is an excellent tracker and will find them.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The scholar places a hand on my shoulder and squeezes – again, that grip traps me more than it physically should – and I nod at the man. He nods back in acknowledgement.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I realize why the scholar’s grip is so entrapping; it reminds me of my mother. My mother would wordlessly squeeze my shoulder when she wanted to me to do chores around the house or to watch my sister for a few hours while she went into town to work. It was to communicate I need you or your sister needs you. Do this without complaint, without hesitation. It’s important.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Now my mother is dead.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I clear my aching throat. “I’ll need one or two people strong enough to carry a stretcher, as well as a healer, and anyone else who can track.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Elexi, Xanen, Pothos, come here!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Two burly men and a woman detach themselves from the people combing through the debris and approach. The woman has a healer satchel strapped to her side.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“The three of you will accompany me and Tysephone on a search for the elders. If their ship was damaged during the storm, they will likely make camp until found. Thankfully the storm hit not too long after they departed. Gather medical and camping supplies for everyone, in case. We leave in ten.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The group disperses and I am left there standing with Arete. All the possessions I own are always on my body, inside my backpack I never take off or hidden inside pockets sewn into the inside folds of my cloak.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Arete turns and leans down to whisper in my ear.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“That’s for puking in my ship.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She walks off. I am left standing there, alone, my cheeks flushed.
</p><p class="mb-4">

~~~
</p><p class="mb-4">

I lead the group of four villagers west into the forest, towards the location where I saw the airship disappear into the storm. After about five miles of walking, I start to look for tracks, but tracking a thing that was in the air is much harder than prey that leaves a ground trail wherever it goes. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

After another mile, we stop at a brook to refill water canteens and I sneak away to slyly use my magic to double check that we are going in the correct direction. I notice that I am still wearing the glove with the marble in the center of my palm. I admire the intricate wire surrounding the marble. I do not think I can stomach anything the scholar made right now. I pull the glove off and place it in my coat pocket. My hand free, I brush my fingers against a tree branch, the pine needles sharp and tickling.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Show me the direction of the elders,” I whisper into the breeze.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The air responds with a gust just to the south of the westerly path I was leading us on. Then it bends up, swirling up pine needles and dead leaves in a flurry before settling back down into the still air. The leaves settle into a cluster, with pine needles connecting the spaces.
</p><p class="mb-4">

We must be close, with elders grouped but not all together. We have a few more hours of sunlight left, so it should be enough time to find them and make camp, but not to walk back, especially if any are injured.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Are the elders alive?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Small purple irises bud from the clusters of leaves. I start counting but realize it wouldn’t matter – I have no idea how many elders were on the airship to begin with anyway. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

At least some of them are alive.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I release the spell, and the irises wilt and disappear into the brush. A breeze rustles the leaves, and they flop over and disperse.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I continue leading the group on the way shown to me by the breeze.
</p><p class="mb-4">

After 15 minutes of walking, I finally find fresh footprints – deer – imprinted in the mud. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Perfect.
</p><p class="mb-4">

We follow the tracks, and after a few minutes, I spot the sought-after doe hidden in the bushes ahead. I hold up my hand, putting a finger to my lips, indicating to the others to be still and silent. I creep towards the deer, now only a few paces, trying to place my feet as lightly as possible to avoid spooking the animal. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The doe looks up from her munching and stares at me inquisitively. I get down to my knees, so very slowly. The deer’s ears twitch. I place my right palm on the damp soil. The soil squishes under my palm. I stare into the doe’s wide brown eyes, and she continues to watch me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Every so softly, I whisper to her, “find me Eurynomos” as I let a small trickle of power pour out of me and into the ground. I quickly staunch the flow. I am surprised at how quickly I have seemed to recover from my earlier spells, especially after puking so many times. I shudder.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Wherever the leader is, the others would assuredly follow. And he’s the only elder I know by name. Anyway, following a deer this close to the elders will be easier than trying to read signs in leaves or flowers. Something about animals always makes my spells better, like they can better understand my requests.
</p><p class="mb-4">

But instead of leading me away, the doe shakes her head to the negative. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

No? 
</p><p class="mb-4">

When I use animals to lead me to water sources or safe places to rest, none have ever denied my request. Even if Eurynomos had died, the doe should have been able to lead me to his body.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Did my storm leave no body to find? 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The movement of the doe’s head, however, illuminates a glint at the front of her neck. I crawl forward two paces more to see a thin strip of purple around the deer’s neck, with a silver hoop connecting the band near the sternum. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

A collar? No… this is no ordinary deer.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stand up, no longer afraid of spooking the animal. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Hey! Doesn’t one of the elders wear a necklace just like this?” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The others in the search party join me, their approached loudly announced by the movement of the bushes around us. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Amateurs. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

But it doesn’t matter. As suspected, the deer does not move, not startled in the least when any normal deer would have been bounding away by now. The female medic says, “Yes, that looks just like necklace Yesimia wears.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

With that, the doe transforms back into the aforementioned elder, unfurling from the feet in a whoosh of fog. As Yesimia stands, she brushes dirt off her dress. “It took you long enough.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Only an elder would have the audacity to criticize her own rescue.
</p><p class="mb-4">

The others are too shocked to speak. I can recognize an advanced spell when I see one, although I certainly did not cast it. Unless I did… 
</p><p class="mb-4">

~~~
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy and I are sitting by the large fireplace in our old cottage, eating the last of the roasted mushrooms I had found in the forest earlier that day. I was still getting used to how my magic worked, and I it was only my desperation to not eat another meal of potato leek soup that I had screamed my rage into the forest, asking no one in particular to help. Then a trail of peonies had sprouted in front of me, and I had followed them to a wild stash of cremini mushrooms. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy is looking rather morose today, pushing the mushrooms and potatoes around her plate without eating.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“What’s wrong?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Nothing.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Was it the dinner? Do you not like it?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Our mother had been working more and more recently, so it was up constantly up to me to make dinner. Hence, my desperation to have ingredients other than potatoes and leeks.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“No, no. I loved it.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Then why do you look like you’ll die if you eat it?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I laugh, but Percy doesn’t take the bait. She just sets down her fork and looks up at me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You’re changing. I don’t want you to leave.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I set down my own plate and go over to where she sits cross legged by the fire, wrapping an arm around her small shoulders.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I will never leave you.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy gives me a dubious look. I pretend to be affronted, mouth opened wide in shock, which finally makes Percy smile.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“And Mother will always look after you too.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

It’s a hollow statement, and we both know it.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“What are worried about anyway?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy stares into the fire, and we sit in silence for a while. But I wait.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I’m afraid to be alone.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I mindless stroke her blonde hair, the short curls bouncing back into place. Even though we are sisters, we look nothing alike. My straight brown hair and dark eyes frame a taut face and tan skin. While Percy’s blond curls frame a square face full of freckles. Her dark hazel eyes and dark bushy eyebrows are unusual given how pale her hair is. Maybe it’ll darken as she gets older.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I will always be there to protect you. And if not, I will make sure you are safe.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy frowns.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“The change you are sensing in me, it’s magic. It’ll let me keep you safe, even when I’m not around.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“How?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I go to the kitchen where I had left a potato too small to eat. I was going to replant it in our yard. I bring it back to the fire, to Percy, cradling it in my palms.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Put your hands around mine.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy does, her hands so small and free of grime compared to mine. I tug on the magic I feel inside me, and I feel the energy pulse. I stare into the potato, trying to channel all my focus into it.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Grow.
</p><p class="mb-4">

A small green tendril pokes out the top of the potato. Then another one unfurls. They lengthen, melding from white near the base to green near the top. Green leaves sprout at the tip. Small tendrils of roots peek out of the boot, curling around our hands. I feel the last of my magic spill out of me and I close the conduit, breathing heavily. The potato, with its new green leaves, looks so delicate, so fragile.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Wooooow.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy’s eyes sparkle with wonder. I set the potato down and take her hands in mine. I call on the power inside me, feel it crossing from me into her. Percy feels it too, and she jolts upright and looks up at me, eyes wide.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I deepen my voice, hoping the somber mood would impress upon her more than my usual silent commands. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Percy, when you are in danger, even when I am not there, this spell will protect you. When you are in danger, a hawk will come down and swoop you up and take you to safety.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“A hawk?! Gross! I want to turn into a bunny!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Okay, okay. When you are in danger, you will turn into a bunny. And while you are a bunny, you will be free and happy as bunnies are, and nothing will be able to hurt you. But once the danger is over, you will return back into your normal body, completely unscathed.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“There has to be a secret password!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stifle a laugh. “The secret password will be… your real name.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy nods rigorously, and I tighten my grip on her hands.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Once the danger is over, only people pure of heart who speak your real name will be able to release you from being a happy little bunny and return you back into your normal self.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She looks at me expectantly.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“As it is said, so is it done.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I know none of this is possible, but it will at least let my sister believe she is safe for longer.
</p><p class="mb-4">

When I really cast the spell, I think protect her before releasing my power in a flurry show of hands. The energy between me and Percy dissipates, but the crackling energy of my protection spell wraps around my sister in a barely perceptible layer.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“As I get stronger, so will the protection spell. I promise.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy nods, and the fear in her eyes is finally replaced with her usual mirth.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Play charesi with me before bed?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Of course.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

~~~
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It’s their names. The storm turned the elders into animals. Say their name to release them from the protection spell.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Yesimia gives me a reproachful look. “How do you know this?” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I’ll explain later. Right now, we need to find the elders before any side effects kick in.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Side effects?! Explain yourself! How do you know this spell?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I think back to Arete’s warning to not admit to casting the storm spell. Did that extend to this protection spell too?
</p><p class="mb-4">

I sigh. They’ll find out soon enough anyway.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It’s part of a made-up protection spell I cast on Percy years ago. I didn’t even think it actually worked…”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I saw the elder’s face change as she processed what I said, realizing what that means.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You’re a mage?!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I look up into the elder’s eyes, really look into her. Her pupils dilate in response, answering her own question.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“The others should be nearby. Spread out. It should be easy to tell who they are.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

An nineteen-year-old girl giving an elder orders. To say the least, Yesimia was not pleased. But I stalk away before she has a chance to interrogate me even further. Thank the skies, the others leave me alone and disperse into the trees.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I use the reprieve to search for Percy. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Curse the elders. Curse them all. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

As it turns out, my tracking skills are too honed for my own good. I quickly find countless other woodland creatures that I know are humans in disguise, but none of them are Percy. And I have absolutely no clue what their names are, so I leave them be and keep looking for Percy. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

After the fifth squirrel, I finally relent.
</p><p class="mb-4">

To Hades.
</p><p class="mb-4">

It’s worth a try, and if the elder can’t understand me in their animal form, then so be it.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Go to the clearing a few paces that way,” I point, “and there will be a medic who will take care of you.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

The squirrel bounds towards the direction I pointed.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I guess they do still understand what’s going on. Good.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Finally, I come upon three large brown rabbits huddled over with a small, white bunny at the center. I know with all my being that the bunny is my sister.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Persephone.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The bunny unspools into my sister, her dark hazel eyes bright with tears.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Tysephone!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She leaps up and wraps her pale arms around me. I instinctively place my protection spell on her as I flatten my palm to her back in the embrace.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I pull back, cupping her cheek in my hands so that I can look into her eyes. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Did they do the ritual?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy shakes her head, and I breathe a sigh of relief. I wasn’t too late. I squeeze her into another hug. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Okay, let’s guide these rabbits back to the medic so that she can say their names and revive them.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Oh,” exclaims Percy, “but I know their names! That’s Sebastian, Theodore, and Cora.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

She points to each rabbit as she says their name. As the three rabbits evolve into humans, a pang of guilt tears through me. Yet another case where my gold-hearted sister managed to learn the names of the elders we stayed with; I made no such attempt. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

It makes their betrayal so much worse.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I direct group back to the clearing with the medic, walking hand in hand with Percy. When we get there, it looks like most of the elders are relatively unscathed, if not a little dazed. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“That should be almost everyone,” says an elder, helping another drink water from a bladder.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I look around for Eurynomos, but he is notably not here. I make one last attempt to find him. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I pull out the glove with the marble from my pocket and put it on, placing my gloved hand on the ground. They will find out I’m a mage soon enough, might as well try to use a trail of flowers to find him since the animal tracking didn’t work.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Show me Eurynomos,” I demand.
</p><p class="mb-4">

As soon as the words leave my mouth, I hear my sister shriek “NO” besides me. I feel the pull of magic tug at me down, hard, and I use my other hand to steady myself, nearly faceplanting into the dirt. The tug on my magic, ragged and forceful, feels wrong. And after this morning, it feels like someone is ripping out my heart, my chest burning. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I scream and collapse onto the ground as the last of magic drains out of me, this time without puking like in the hovercraft.

The ground ripples and vibrates. I prop myself up to see the ground falling inwards upon itself to reveal a hole above ten feet wide. The felling of death assaults my senses. I follow everyone’s gaze to the hole and shuffle a few steps towards it to peek over the edge. Below the surface is a chasm, with about a three-foot drop to flowing body of water. The water is almost completely obscured by corpses floating on their backs, their milky white eyes staring unfocusedly upwards as they slowly drift to the left. Next to a bearded man with no legs lies Eurynomos on his back, blood oozing from his nose and lifeless eyes. I realize Eurynomos is very much dead, that I am looking at the River Styx taking him to Hades.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I just opened a chasm into the underworld.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Suddenly, Eurynomos – still very dead – stands up in the water and jumps up, grabbing Percy’s ankles who had also snuck over to the side of the chasm. Percy shrieks as she is hauled into the hole. Her head clears the ground, but she makes a big splash as she falls into the river. Fetid water mists my face. It tastes like rotting corpses. Bodies helplessly bob away from where Percy and Eurynomos now stand in the Styx. Thankfully, it is not that deep, and the water rises only to her navel. But Percy is clearly about to cry.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Eurynomos grabs Percy by the wrist. “You are mine, Persephone. You WILL tell me how I die.” Spittle flies out his mouth and collects on his dark beard.
</p><p class="mb-4">

That is enough! The dead are dead, and I need a distraction.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Hey Eurynomos!” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The dead man turns his head up towards me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“If you touch my baby sister, I will be the one to kill you. Again.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

He doesn’t budge.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I will condemn your soul to Hades for eternity. You don’t need my sister for you to know this.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I let my power flow again. It feels like dragging my insides through dry sand, but I push on. There is a pomegranate by my feet, which I pick up and hold in front of me. I squeeze my gloved hand in a fist and then push towards him. The pomegranate flies out of my hand and slams into Eurynomos’s head and imploding into a red mist upon impact but sending him backwards into the water. Thankfully, he releases his grip on my sister in the process. She wades towards me, and I lunge into the chasm to grab her, flattening myself onto the ground. She grabs my hands, but with her extra weight, I feel myself sliding further into a hole.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Oh no.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Then someone grabs my ankles and yanks me, with Percy still attached, out of the hole.
</p><p class="mb-4">

As soon as Percy is clear, both of us safely on normal ground, I cut off the magic feeding the spell. It resists at first, the spell still tugging and burning on my inside. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

No. Close. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I imagine my power being squeezed, ceasing the flow of power. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

You cannot have more of me.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Finally, I shut the conduit, and the hole starts to shrink, but too slowly. Eurynomos, now recovered from the rock assault, jumps up and grabs the edge of the hole as if he is meaning to crawl out of the chasm himself.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Not happening.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stomp on his hands, and he falls back down into the water. I continue to stand guard and the last of the hole closes, but Eurynomos just remains standing in the water, glaring at me. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

The ground closes and remains still. It is deathly silent, like everyone was holding their breath. Then Percy bursts into hysterical sobs. I squeeze her to my side, her drenched clothes also making my breeches wet.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You’re okay, you’re okay.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stroke Percy’s hair, like I always do. Her hysterical sobs dwindle to silent vibrations as she presses her face into my side.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Charon, the only mage of the community and thus elder despite the fact that he mustn’t be over than 30, approaches us. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You spoke to the dead.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

He looks at me appalled.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I didn’t know he was dead.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy stops silent sobbing. I look down at her. She is staring at her feet, water pooling around both of us. I hear her quietly murmur, “I pushed him.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I kneel down, lifting her chin so that she is forced to look into my eyes. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Tell me what happened.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It was before the storm. I was so scared. I didn’t know, I … I didn’t want to see how they die. When he came towards me, I pushed. He went over the edge of the ship. And then I saw the storm approaching and everything went black.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

She does not need to tell me that she used magic to push Eurynomos overboard. We both know she is not physically capable of pushing a gigantic man like that, much less casting them overboard from the center of the airship while tied up. But Percy cannot cast spells like I can, she can only see the future. The only way she could have magically pushed Eurynomos is through my protection spell, which was probably what triggered it in the first place. I had no idea it could do something like that, that is would launch into effect and could spin others into the protection spell with her.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I guess I did kill someone, in a way.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“You will pay for the damage you have caused. Our airship is in ruins.” Charon tries to muster some amount of foreboding into the reprimand, but it doesn’t fool me.

“You dare to reprimand me. You had no right to use Percy like that. Her gift is not something to be taken.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

For emphasis, I put my body between him and my sister. For the first time, I make eye contact with the mage. I sense him truly look into my eyes, the recognition of my power flashing across his face, his pupils dilating in response. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

For the moment our eyes connect, I can feel his own power as he can feel mine. His power feels like a small river pebble – solid, cold, warped smooth by years of careful polishing. It is so polished that sunlight glints off its surface, illuminating it despite having no light source of his own. I know that my power is all rage and storm. When I look at my reflection, my eyes are the darkest part of the night sky, with abysmal gray clouds that block out all starlight. The deepness of that void is only broken by flashes of lightning that burst against the edges of my irises.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It’ll take me weeks to make another airship and mend whatever destruction you’ve done to the caves. With another mage, especially one as … strong as you, it’ll be done in only days. And I think I speak for the rest of the elders when I say both of you are banished from our community once that task is completed.” Charon gives me a pointed look. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I suspect he expects me to feel remorse about it, but I do not. In fact, an excuse to leave is all I want.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I agree with you that we no longer belong here. But if you make me do anything, I will destroy…”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Tysephone, please.” Percy squeezes my hand.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I take a deep breath.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I must be a role model for my sister.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I will help you rebuild if you apologize to my sister and agree to never force a mage’s power upon them ever again, solidified by a blood oath.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Charon nods. “Fine.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Good.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“But you need to go to Delphi where all the scholars are. You have too much wild magic in you not to be trained by them.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“What do you care?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It is for the well-being of everyone that you go. You need to be trained. And the three sisters who lead Delphi are seers themselves. It will be good for Percy, too.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Fine, Percy and I will go to Delphi.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

We will not. We will just leave.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I will accompany both of you, and Arete must come as well, since her hovercraft is the only airship we have left, and Zeus knows she is the only one who can fly that thing.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“No need. Percy and I can manage just fine.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I insist. It will be much faster and safer to travel, especially with the war to the north.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“How about you give Percy an apology first, with the blood oath, and then we can talk about Delphi.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“We can put Delphi into the blood oath.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“No!”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Again, I must insist. Your sister’s crime of murdering an elder is punishable by death. Consider this payment.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stare at him. He stares back. I have no magic left in me to fight my way out of this one. Not now. I see his power bubbling inside of him.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Hades.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Fine. Apologize now though.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

I will make you beg for it.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Percy, I am deeply sorry about the ritual.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

He proffers his hand to Percy, which slightly trembles. He trails off, clearly finished. My sister moves to shake his hand, but I squeeze her shoulder and she stills. 
</p><p class="mb-4">

Always so forgiving.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Not good enough,” I growl.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Charon scowls.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“It would be easy it to crack a stone with lightning.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

I hope Charon cannot see through my bluff. That despite the storm inside me, that despite how much they deserve retribution for trying to force my sister to use her power, that despite how much I want to be able to enact that justice, I cannot bring myself to intentionally hurt someone.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“I see now the powers at play,” he pointedly looks at me, “Eurynomos shamed our community. Please forgive us… I am forever indebted to you.” 
</p><p class="mb-4">

With that, I release Percy. I do what is expected of me as my sister’s role model, even if it grinds my teeth to dust. I clasp Charon’s forearm. “Apology accepted.” I encourage the marble at the center of my glove to spark, ever so slightly, and am rewarded when he quickly pulls his hand back, rubbing where my palm met the inside of his arm. I keep my face as composed as ever.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“When we get back to the caves, I’ll draw up the blood oath.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“As you wish,” I say. Once we are on the road, it will be easy for us to slip away from him.
</p><p class="mb-4">

Percy bounces a little, clasping at my arm. “Adventure! Where is Delphi?”
</p><p class="mb-4">

Charon gives her a wide grin. “Near the southern coast. It’s about a two month walk by land, but by air, we’ll get there within a week. The ticky part will be convincing Arete to loan us her hovercraft.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Who’s Arete?” my sister asks.
</p><p class="mb-4">

“Just a pilot with a hovercraft who lives atop the mountain.”
</p><p class="mb-4">

If Charon knew Arete was a scholar, he surely would have said something. And wouldn’t have insisted we go to Delphi.
</p><p class="mb-4">

We set up camp for the night, but in another clearing. It is without saying that the ground where the hole to the underworld was must never be disturbed again. It takes us the entirety of the following day to hike the six miles back to the community center. By the time we arrive at the destroyed landing platform, I have already devised and discarded five different escape plans, or ways to get out of the enforced chaperone. I concluded that Arete is just too much of a wildcard to plan around. At least, until I get some answers from her.
</p><p class="mb-4">

I stalk up the hillside to the cave where the pretend pilot lives with her hovercraft. I need to find out her secrets. I slip the glove with the marble onto my hand. The marble vibrates in its web, sending shudders up my arm. I can do nothing to stop the magic from swirling around me, pulling at me with such force that it mocks my attempt to escape the inevitability of my destiny.
