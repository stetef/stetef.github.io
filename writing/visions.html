<p class="mb-4">
This short story was written as the beginning of a longer story. It is a retelling of Persephone, but with steampunk elements.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
<b>Content warning: Death, violence</b>       
</p>

<hr style="height:3px">

<p class="mb-4">
“You can’t do this!” Strong hands grasp my arms and waist, rendering me useless, as Percy is dragged away, her slight frame and blonde curls disappearing behind the throng of bodies.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
A shadow looms. “This must be done,” Acacius intonates. His gray eyes and smile are full of pity. I want to smack his senile, condescending grin to the depths of Hades. Acacius turns his back to me, walking down the stairs to join the rest of the cohort of elders on the airship. The sails are raised as he ties my little sister to the deck. She looks up and says something, which is promptly drowned out as gigantic engines whirl to life. The large wooden hull rises, blasting the rest of us with a whoosh of air, blowing away any hope of grabbing Percy and escaping into the surrounding forest.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Too late to do anything, I yank my arms free. We should have left when we had the chance. I knew the risks with staying in one place for too long. But Percy wanted to stay. So we stayed.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Free of my constraints, I run up the trail that circumnavigates the mountain, desperately peering into the sculpted caves that sporadically pocket the cliffside. I cannot let them force my sister into using her power. The last time that happened, she saw our own mother’s death. And despite our race back home and all that we did, we couldn’t prevent it from happening. She was so innocent then. Now, Percy wakes up screaming every day, reliving that moment over and over for the past nine months. I do not know how to help her separate her visions from reality and cannot imagine what another episode would do to her. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I bare down and force myself to breathe. My heart thrums against my ribcage, my legs burning all over, as I rush up the sloping road. Finally, next to one of the small landing platforms, I see what I need – a small hovercraft tied against an inner wall. I unmoor the craft, throwing the coarse rope into the basket, and roll the thing back and forth to the edge of the platform. I am about to climb in when I hear someone say “You cannot possibly think you can fly that” from inside the cavern. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
A short, middle-aged woman with the sun-tanned skin of a pilot crosses her arms, giving me a dubious look. It must be Arete, hopefully last scholar I meet. The intricate tattoos indicating her schooling poke out from the sleeves of her flying jacket. While they may look like ordinary tattoos, I feel the magic swirling in conjunction within. So much for avoiding her. I revert my eyes down to the hovercraft, lest she sees the power sparkling behind them.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Well, can you pilot this for me? I need to get to my sister.” When she doesn’t move, I add “Please, I know you can fly. We need to get to her before they make her lose her mind. You have to help me.” My pleas must sound absolutely pathetic against unwilling ears.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“To be clear, you are asking me to go against my village elders to stop a ritual that benefits me?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Heat rises to my cheeks. “Yes! It won’t help you if my sister loses her mind and cannot recognize reality. You of all people should know how unpredictable foresight is.” I stare back into the eyes of this coward. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
An expression I cannot quite place crosses the scholar’s features before she recomposes herself. Finally, she moves, grabbing her headgear and hopping into the basket. “You are lucky I happen to very much like your sister and think it is about time that someone stands up to Acacius.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I am still amazed that the scholar agreed to help when she says, “What are you waiting for? Hop in.” I shake myself out of my stupefaction and do so.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
With that, we take off, not as fast as I would have liked, and the hovercraft sputters before settling into a monotonous rise from the single puttering engine. The vibrations make my hands numb where I grip onto the woven basket, steadying myself while willing us to go faster. After only a few heartbeats at altitude, I know we won’t catch up. Despite the lighter craft, our forward thrusters cannot keep pace with the behemoth sails on the elder’s airship. The wind that powers those sails whips at the strands of hair around my face that got loose from their braids.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Is this as fast as you can go?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The silence all the confirmation I need. I look over to see the scholar giving me the same pitying look that Acacius gave me. <i>To Hades with that look.</i>
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I take a deep breath to gather myself, mustering the courage to do what I need to do next. “Teach me how to cast a rain spell then,” I demand.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Excuse me?” The scholar turns off the forward thrusters and we stall in midair.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“They will be forced to land if it’s raining, right? The lift engines won’t work with the extra moisture.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“First of all, your attitude is preposterous. Second, I’m not sure how you know that, but there isn’t a cloud in the sky. How are you going to collect enough moisture to make it rain?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“There is a lake seven miles north that I will borrow water from.” I remember passing it three weeks ago, before Percy and I found the cave dwelling community. Well, before <i>they</i> found <i>us</i>. Their hunter happened to check their snares at the same inopportune time I was relieving them of their catch. It feels like that was an eternity ago. With as much sincerity as I can summon, I add a “please.” That rewards me with at least a moment of consideration.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I don’t think that’s a good idea. Too much change could have catastrophic consequences. Have you even used weather work before?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I think back to the tracking magic I used when necessary to help Percy and I survive for the past six months in the wilderness. Every time, it required all my focus to limit the magic from taking more than what it needed, limiting the small uses of magic to just scratching the top of the well rather than losing myself into the spell. “No, but I’m capable. And I know you were good at your previous job.” Okay, I don’t know, but mage-scholars don’t leave Delphi easily.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“A mage without experience in weather work should not cast such a large spell without a focusing device, especially one that requires conversion of a resource <i>and</i> a moving target.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Fine. If you won’t help me.” I raise my hands, directing my will towards the airship, imagining rain hitting the wooden hull and interrupting the lift engines.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
A hiss echoes in my ears as the scholar grabs my hands, pulling them down. “You’ll kill us both if you do that.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
But I have already called upon magic, and it ripples invisibly around us, waiting for a purpose. The hair on my arm raises, the air like electricity, crackling. The scholar mumbles curses under her breath as well as some other choice words I haven’t heard before.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Weather likes being given clear instructions. If you do not be specific, it will use the ambiguity to strike you down with lightning unless you give all your energy,” she jabs a finger into my chest, “some direction. Give me a second.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The scholar bends down an opens the engine hatch at the base of the craft. A bound leather case is strapped to the underside of a fan shield. She expertly unlatches the case, not flinching as the rotating fans go <i>thrump, thrump</i> inches from her arm. The scholar refastens the engine hatch and rummages around in the satchel. “You are right-handed, yes?” She asks. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I nod. She keeps looking for something and then looks up at me expectantly. Realizing she did not see me, I stammer, “Y-yes, I’m right-handed.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Perfect. Put this on your right hand.” She tosses me a small black cloth that I catch out of the air. It is heavier than expected, and I realize it is a glove with the fingers cut off, a circular metal ring sewn into the palm. The scholar then yanks the left sleeve of my coat up past my elbow and clasps a leather sleeve the entire length of my forearm, sinching the three buckles tight. It is still a little loose, even at the smallest notch. Three circular rings that match the one on my glove lie lengthwise down my arm.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I made this for my mage,” the scholar says. She clicks three gadgets into the three circular rings on my new arm sleeve, the two closest to my elbow looking like copies of each other. My arm suddenly feels very heavy, and it is only because the scholar grasps my arm that I am able to hold it up for more than a second.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“These first two help you direct the elements – earth, air, water, and light.” As she says each element, she points to the corresponding symbol etched into one of four concentric circles. “Because you are converting lake water to rain, we need to set the first element director to earth and water. Use the biggest dial for water and the second biggest dial to earth. Make sure not to move the smallest two dials away from the blank spot, or you will initiate another element without giving it direction.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The gold dials are cold to the touch, and my fingers, already numb from the flight, feel extra clumsy, especially with the foreign glove.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Next, we need to set this director to water and air.” I rotate the dials of the middle director like the first, except the second dial one tick counterclockwise so that air is in position under the indicator at the top of the dials.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“The last director is because we have a moving target. We don’t have enough time for me to explain relational spherical coordinates to you, so I’ll do this one.” She adjusts the three slightly different lengthened to pointer radially out at different directions, looking up at the airship and making slight adjustments.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“One last piece.” She brings another circular gadget over from her satchel and claps it into the circular ring in the palm of my right hand. The copper wire weaves like a spiderweb from the outside in, converging on a smooth white marble at the center. The wire makes closing my fist stiff but not impossible. “This is a focuser and helps you connect your directors to your magic and will.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Copy me.” She raises her right hands straight in front of her, her left arm relaxed at her side. I do the same, relieved I can finally drop my heavy left arm. “Good. Now that you have set up the spell, you need to give it the indication to start. With as much intention as you can muster, throw your hand down like this,” she demonstrates, pretending to slap her hand down on an imaginary table in front of her, “while thinking of what you want to happen.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
This part, at least, I am familiar with; the palm to the Earth is the same way I initiate my tracking spells, just without all the gear. I stare at the slowly diminishing airship. It is easy to summon intention from all my rage and desperation. In my head, I shout <i>Rain!</i> and bring my palm down forcibly, fingers splayed.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The air, crackling with energy around us, explodes outward. I feel the pull of magic, asking for more, and this time, I let it take all that it demands. A waterspout rises from the lake far to our left and comes careening towards the airship in front of us. The sky darkens as clouds form. Another tug of magic, and I feel my autonomy leave myself. To my horror, I see the beginning of tornados forming from the ground up to the bank of clouds above us. I didn’t just make rain; I made a storm. The hovercraft rocks precariously in the air as a gust of wind forcibly knocks us sideways, breaking my focus just enough that the magic loosens its grip on me.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Hold on!” shouts the scholar as we go streaming up towards the clouds. I look to my left to see the tip of a forming cyclone rising besides us, keeping pace with our ascent. We race the tornados up. Just before we enter the cloud bank, I see a tornado swallow the target airship, the airship with my sister on it. I don’t have any time to process as we are immediately surrounded by the crackle and hiss of electricity discharging within the clouds before it builds enough energy to come cracking down to the ground in a bolt of lightning. <i>I didn’t give weather enough direction. I knew I didn’t sign the directions correctly.</i> I sit down in the basket and close my eyes, preparing for the lightning about to strike us down. <i>Will the electrocution hurt?</i> My racing heart beats against my chest, as if my instinctual will to live will counteract the jolt of electricity about to course through my body and stop my heart.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
<i>Pound. Pound. Pound.</i> The lightning never strikes. We finally pop out the clouds to the peaceful skies above. A gray miasma of clouds and bright snapshots of light roil beneath us. I suck in a sharp breath, the cold air hurting my lungs, my racing heart and lack of oxygen making me lightheaded. Or the fact that I just cast the largest spell in my life.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“How do I make it stop?” I manage to ask before puking over the side of the craft. <i>I’m going to die anyways, aren’t I?</i>
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“With enough intention. Take off the director arm band though. Keep the focusing glove on. But if the storm has been allowed to gather enough momentum, it might be too late. And you are in no shape to cast another weather spell.” The scholar had donned a helmet and mask during our ascent, the latter now slightly muffling her words. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I am about to protest that I very much can cast another one when I puke, <i>again</i>. I am about wipe my mouth on my sleeve, realize my new gadgets make that impossible, and use the hem of my cloak instead. The back of my throat burns with bile. My head feels like it might explode. My body is about ready to collapse. I didn’t want people to die. I just wanted the ritual to stop. I loosen the leather arm sleeve and I am about to throw it onto the deck when the scholar lunges and grabs it out of my hand.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I flex my gloved hand, admiring the flex and pop of the intricate woven wire. I force my stomach to settle enough to scrunch my hand into a fist, squeezing as tight as I can around the marble. “Stop!” I scream, this time aloud. I open myself up, letting all my magic reserves to spill into that one word.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Thankfully, the clouds begin to clear. As the gray mist dissipates, I survey the damage. We are dizzyingly high, and I can see impossibly far. There are swaths of forest completely flattened of all trees. But the elders’ airship is nowhere in sight. As we descend, I start to feel better, although I heave over the side of the craft one more time, nothing left in my stomach to up. The scholar hands me a piece of a golden tuber, directing me to suck on the root as she does the same. The strong scent and taste make my eyes water, but it helps with the nausea.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The small cluster of buildings at the base of the mountain, including the landing platform, is completely obliterated, wood lying in splinters everywhere. Thankfully, most people, other than the elders on the ship, were inside the caves at this time of day. I see people walking through the rubble, surveying the damage. The smell of fresh cut pine fills my nostrils as we near, overpowering the last bit of the spicy root in my mouth.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
We land on the edge of the desecrated mass wood that was the landing platform, and the mage scholar jumps out of the basket. I follow her. A man who I recognize but do not know by name has clearly taken charge of the recovery crew, barking orders to those present.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Arete, thank the skies you are okay.” He embraces her in a full body hug.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Is anyone hurt or missing?” the scholar asks.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Everyone is accounted for, other than the fifteen elders on the airship. To think, all our village history and mages lost in a spelled storm.” His face is full of grief. I am overcome with such a wave of guilt that it takes me a moment to remember to breathe. I open my mouth to confess to my part in creation of the storm when the scholar lays a heavy hand on my shoulder.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Maybe the ritual went amiss, and they accidentally summoned a storm,” she says. My surprise at her covering for me quickly diminishes when Arete gives me a “we’ll talk about this later” look. It makes me wonder whether the others know that she is a scholar.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I will lead the search party,” I say, hoarsely. I swallow, but it does not soothe the lump in my throat. I feel it in my bones that Percy is not dead. But something is not right. And finding the bodies of the dead elders is the least I can do. I deserve to look into the blank eyes of those I killed anyway.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I lead a group of four villagers west into the forest, our party consisting of two medics, a brawny warrior, and another tracker. After a couple miles of walking, I find fresh footprints of a deer imprinted in the mud. It is exactly what I need. I motion for the others to be still and silently follow the tracks a few paces until I see the sought-after doe hidden in the bushes ahead. She looks at me inquisitively. I get down on my knees. I notice I am still wearing the focusing glove that Arete gave me. I again admire the intricate wire surrounding the marble before I put it in my pocket. I place my right palm on the damp soil. The scent of petrichor mixing with the squish of the earth beneath me. The villagers will find out soon enough that I am a mage, so I might as well use my power to help them.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I stare into the doe’s wide brown eyes, and I whisper, “Find me Acacius.” Wherever the leader is, the others would assuredly follow, even in death.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The doe, surprisingly, shakes her head to the negative. <i>No?</i> No animal has denied my request before. <i>Did the magical storm truly leave no body to find?</i> The movement of the doe’s head, however, illuminates a glint at the front of her neck. I crawl forward two paces more to see a purple leather collar around the deer’s neck, with a silver hoop connecting the band near the sternum. This is no ordinary deer.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I stand up, no longer afraid of spooking the animal away. “Hey! Doesn’t one of the elders wear a necklace just like this?” I call to the others in the search party.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
They join me, their approached loudly announced by the movement of the bushes around us. As suspected, the deer does not move. One of the medics says, “Yes, that looks just like necklace Jessimaia wears.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
At the announcement of the name, the doe transforms back into the aforementioned elder. As Jessimaia stands, she brushes off her dress. “It took you long enough.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The others are too shocked to speak. I can recognize an advanced spell when I see one, although I certainly did not cast this one. “What happened?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Jessimaia gives me a reproachful look. “If I had to guess, your tornadoes, spelled with the intention of stopping the ritual, combined with Yanis’s protection spell to turn us into woodland creatures. Very juvenile, by the way. The others should be around here.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
"Where is Percy?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Like I said, the others should be nearby, including Percy, child.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The guilt rises like bile, but I force it down. The bitter taste from earlier is still left in my mouth.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I am relieved when the elder assumes the leadership position, despite her presumptuous demeanor. “Spread out,” says the elder, “and if you find any animal, say their name and they will revert to their normal selves. It should be clear who they are.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I use the reprieve to search for Percy, but instead quickly find other human-turned-woodland-creatures, recognizing the human faces to which belong but not knowing their names. I direct each one to the clearing where one of the medics resides, hoping the find their way. After four of these exchanges, I come upon a fluffle of bunnies, with a small, white one at the center. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Percy!” The small white rabbit unspools into my sister, her blue eyes bright with tears.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Kaia!” she wraps her pale arms around me, and I instinctively hug her back with a protection spell flattened between my palm and her back.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I cup her cheek in my hands. “Did they…?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Percy shakes her head, and I breathe a sigh of relief. I wasn’t too late. I squeeze her again. “Okay, let’s guide these rabbits back to the medic so that she can say their names and revive them.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“Oh,” exclaims Percy, “but I know their names! That’s Sebastian, Yanis, Cora, and Theodore.” She points to each bunny as she says their name.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
As the four bunnies evolve into humans, another pang of guilt tears through me. It is another case where my amazing sister managed to learn the names of the villagers, where I made no such attempt. It makes their betrayal of her feel so much worse.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I direct group back to the clearing with the medic, which now contains almost every missing elder, most of whom are relatively unscathed. I look around and count, noting everyone is here except for Acacius. I make one last attempt to find the village leader.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I pull out the focusing glove from my pocket and put it on, placing my right palm on the ground. “Show me Acacius,” I demand, hoping an earthen trail will lead me to him.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
As soon as the words leave my mouth, I hear my sister shriek “NO” besides me. I feel the pull of magic tug at me down, hard, and I use my other hand to steady myself, nearly faceplanting into the dirt.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
The ground ripples and vibrates, falling inwards upon itself to reveal a hole above five feet in diameter. The felling of death assaults my senses. I peek over the edge into the chasm below to see a body of water a few feet below the opening.  The water is almost completely obscured by corpses floating on their backs, their milky white eyes staring unfocusedly upwards as they slowly drift to the left. Next to a bearded man with no legs lies Acacius, blood oozing from his nose and dead eyes. Acacius is very much dead, the river Styx already taking him to Hades.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Suddenly, a very dead Acacius stands up in the water and grabs Percy’s ankles, who snuck over to the side of the chasm to investigate. Percy shrieks as she is involuntarily hauled into the hole, making a loud splash as she falls into the river, bodies helpless bobbing in the resulting waves. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
When my sister surfaces (thankfully, the Styx is shallow enough that when Percy stands, it rises only to her navel), Acacius shouts “You are mine, Persephone. You WILL share with me the secrets of the future.” Spittle flies from his dark beard. He pushes a body out from between him and my sister, the latter of which has been slowly backing away.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I need a distraction. I yell “Hey Acacius!” The dead man stops his approach and turns his head up towards me. “If you touch my baby sister, I will kill you. Again.” I squeeze my gloved hand in a fist and then splay my hand towards him. A rock the size of my fist comes whizzing past me and slams into Acacius’s head, sending him backwards into the water. I flatten myself onto the ground, someone grabs my ankles, and I throw my torso into the chasm, grabbing my sister by her outstretched arms. The person holding my ankles pulls, and I, with my sister in tow, am hauled out. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
As soon as Percy is clear, I cut off the magic feeding the spell and the hole starts to shrink. Acacius, now recovered from the rock assault, jumps up to again, either to grab at Percy or crawl out of the cavity. Either way, I have had enough. I stomp on his hands, and he falls back down into the water. The ground closes and remains still. I cannot hear anything over my heaving panting. I squeeze Percy to my side, her drenched clothes also making my trousers wet.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
After a moment, Yanis says, “You spoke to the dead.” He looks at me appalled.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I didn’t know he was dead,” I say.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Percy looks down at her feet, water pooling around her, and I hear her quietly murmur, “I pushed him.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
I kneel down, lifting her chin so that she is forced to look into my eyes. “Tell me what happened.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“It was before the storm. I was so scared. I didn’t want to see. So when he came towards me, I <i>pushed</i>. He went over the edge of the ship.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
She does not need to tell me that she used magic to do so. We both know she is not physically capable of pushing a gigantic man overboard, especially from the center of the airship. But Percy cannot cast spells like I can, she can only see. The only magic she had remotely any access to is my protection spell, the one I have been placing over her since our mother died. I had no idea it could do something like that.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
<i>I guess I did kill someone.</i>
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I think I speak for the rest of the elders when I say both of you are no longer welcome in our community.” Yanis gives me a pointed look. “And you have too much wild magic to not be in control. You are lucky I acted quickly enough that more people didn’t get hurt, otherwise we would be having a very different conversation. It’ll take me weeks to make another airship and mend whatever damage you’ve done.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“You are worried about making another airship?! You had no right to use Percy like that. Her gift is not something to be taken.” For emphasis, I put my body between him and my sister. For the first time, I make eye contact with the mage. I sense him truly look into my eyes, the power behind his feels like the smooth stone. I feel like all rage and storm.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
He proffers his hand, which slightly trembles. “I was the one conducting the seeing ritual, and I am deeply sorry. I see now the powers at play.” He trails off, waiting. I still do not speak. “After that show from Acacius, trying to kill a girl after death, I’m ashamed. Please forgive us.” 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
With that, I look at Percy and she nods. <i>Always so forgiving.</i> I do what is expected of me as my sister’s role model, even if it grinds my teeth to dust. I clasp Yanis’s forearm. “Apology accepted.” I encourage the marble at the center of my glove to spark, ever so slightly, and am rewarded when he quickly pulls his hand back, rubbing where my palm met the inside of his arm. I keep my face as composed as ever.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I will accompany you to Delphi. The scholars there can supposedly help you control your powers. And they will know what to do with a seer. I have always wanted to go there myself, but have never gotten. I suppose now is the time.” He chuckles like he said something funny.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“As you wish,” I say. Once we are on the road, it will be easy for us to slip away from him.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Percy bounces a little, clasping at my arm. “Adventure! Where is Delphi?”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Yanis gives her a toothy grin. “Near the southern coast. It’s about a two month walk by land, but by air, we’ll get there within a week. We just need to convince Arete to loan us her hovercraft.”
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
“I will talk to her,” I immediately volunteer.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
By the time we have walked the few miles back to the destroyed landing platform, I have already devised and discarded five escape plans. Arete is just too much of a wildcard. I stalk up the hillside to the cave where the pretend pilot lives with her hovercraft. I need to find out the scholar’s secrets. The marble in my palm vibrates, sending shudders up my arm. I can do nothing to stop the magic from swirling around me, pulling at me with such force that it mocks my attempt to escape the inevitability of my destiny.
