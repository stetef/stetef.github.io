The following books I have read (or listened to) in 2023. I have short blurbs below about each. Of all the books I read this year, I would recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61937038">To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose</a>. 
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Hopefully coming soon as well is a form where you can share with me any books you think I should read! 
</p>

<hr style="height:3px">

<p>
Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik <br>
<font color=#7ca6c2> - A retelling of Rumpelstiltskin but totally cool because it's Naomi Novik </font>
</p>

<p>
The City We Became my N.K. Jemisin
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I liked the Killing Moon series better but this was fun, esp if you are familiar with the NYC boroughs </font>
</p>

<p>
Burn by Patrick Ness
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Cold War meets dragons and parallel universes. I liked the weird religious dragon cult lol </font>
</p>

<p>
A Lady's Guide to Celestial Mechanics by Olivia Waite
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - A feminist, spicy romance book about science and art </font>
</p>

<p>
Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Would recommend for anyone who is a woman, or loves them </font>
</p>

<p>
The Witch's Heart by Genevieve Gornichec
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I suppose this retelling of Angrboða is better than traditional Nose mythology but it still made me cringe</font>
</p>

<p>
Wool by Hugh Howey
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Dystopian, don't trust anyone, and watch as the puzzle unfurls with these badass female characters</font>
</p>

<p>
Deadly Education, The Last Graduate, The Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I LOVE NAOMI NOVIK. This high stakes magic school (you actually feel like the stakes are high) with a main character like Wednesday Addams </font>
</p>

<p>
Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - The first half of this book triggered me and then I was just sad </font>
</p>

<p>
The Amulet of Samarkand by Jonathan Stroud
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - The use of footnotes and the humor is amazing </font>
</p>

<p>
Ninth House, Hell Bent by Leigh Bardugo
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Yale secret societies actually do dark magic. Love talking to my friends who went to Yale about this hehe </font>
</p>

<p>
Polysecure by Jessica Fern
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - An interesting perspective on attachment theory </font>
</p>

<p>
The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Wow so much to say here. Loved the strong female cast but honestly I would have just read a story about Ead </font>
</p>

<p>
Our Missing Hearts by Celeste Ng
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Just a good book all around 10/10 </font>
</p>

<p>
And Finally by Henry Marsh
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Did not like this at all ugh would NOT recommend. It just felt like an old dude complaining about being old (not insightful), virtue signaling, and blaming testosterone on his infidelty and failed first marriage (my dude what) </font>
</p>

<p>
All Systems Red by Martha Wells
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Fun satirical quick read about a cyborg programmed to kill things that hacked its brain so that it could watch soap operas in its spare time </font>
</p>

<p>
What If? by Randall Munroe
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Fun lil read </font>
</p>

<p>
Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - The plot was a little predictable but still a good read </font>
</p>

<p>
An Ember in the Ashes, A Torch Against the Night, A Reaper at the Gates, A Sky Beyond the Storm by Sabaa Tahir
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I fell in love with this series so much wow just check it out it is amazing. My only negative opinion of the entire series is that parts of the romance between Laia and Elias are pretty cringey with sterotypes </font>
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - So good. I'd say this is a story about relationships of all kinds with really clever nonchronological excerpts. Will make you feel things </font>
</p>

<p>
Fourth Wing, Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Book 1 was entertaining and hella spicy even though it was hella tropey. I actually liked the unique meshing of romance and fantasy -- the world always felt accessible unlike a lot of other fantasy books that drop you in the middle of fantasy lingo and you are confused the first quarter of the book. The tropes just meant you can't take it too seriously. Book 2 went downhill, you don't need to read it </font>
</p>

<p>
The Butcher and the Wren by Alaina Urquhart
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Interesting POV from a psychopathic killer. Had to reread the plot twist to understand what was happening though </font>
</p>

<p>
All That She Carried by Tiya Alicia Miles
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - About Ashley's sack, and what it takes to put together its historical story, especially when information is missing or incomplete</font>
</p>

<p>
The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - A good wholesome book with characters that all feel different yet relatable in the best possible away </font>
</p>

<p>
A Darker Shade of Magic, A Gathering of Shadows, A Conjuring of Light by V. E. Schwab
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - The audiobook narrators change in books 2 and 3 and make it infintely better. I loved the worlds and the characters in this. Mostly, I love V.E. Schwab's work</font>
</p>

<p>
Gideon the Ninth, Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Don't get me wrong, the books are good. I love Gideon. And maybe listening to this as an audiobook made it worse, but I was (and still am) very confused, although I have a feeling that was Tamsyn Muir's intention </font>
</p>

<p>
The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - V.E. Schwab, is this you admitting to selling your soul to write such good books? (Yes, the meta commentary in this was hilarious.) The nonchronological storytelling was really well done </font>
</p>

<p>
Storm Front by Jim Butcher
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I would describe this as popcorn to read on stormy fall evenings. Clearly written by a dude though lol </font>
</p>

<p>
Twisted Love, Twisted Games by Ana Huang
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Smutty BDSM, what more do you want</font>
</p>

<p>
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - Really interesting. Again the parallel stories told in chronological order was well done and I did NOT catch the twist at the end </font>
</p>

<p>
The Stardust Thief by Chelsea Abdullah
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I liked the City of Brass series by S. A. Chakraborty a little better, but it was really interesting to compare the different takes on similar themes between the two series (e.g. the magical significance of rings and the different social classes of djinn). Aisha takes the crown though </font>
</p>

<p>
To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - This might be my new favorite dragon book. I especially like how the cadence feels like an oral story, and oral stories are prevelant in the story itself. Can't wait for book 2! Of all the books I read this year, I would recommend reading this one!</font>
</p>

<p>
Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I have to admit that I saw the Netflix show before reading this... The Crows were my favorite part of the show though so it was a little sad not to see them here </font>
</p>

<p>
Chemistry by Weike Wang
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I can see how this might trigger grad students but the interludes and very dry/dark sense of humor made it hilarious and any grad student will relate </font>
</p>

<p>
A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas
<br><font color=#7ca6c2> - I have been procrastinating on reading these because it was SO mainstream but I was promised it actually breaks the tropes it sets up so I was just waiting for the shoe to drop... Apparently book 2 is where it is at though...</font>
</p>
